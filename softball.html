			<h2>What is softball?</h2>
			<p>Softball is a sport very similar to baseball, with the goal of the game being to hit the ball and score runs while on the offensive side, and to obstruct the other team from scoring runs while on the 
			defensive side.</p>
			<h2>The Invention of Softball</h2>
			<p>Contrary to popular belief, the sport of softball was not derived from baseball, but was actually created randomly inside the Farragut Boat Club in Chicago, <abbr title="Illinois">IL</abbr>.</p>
			<p>In 1887, a crowd was grouped inside of the Farrgyt Boat Club awaiting the results of the Harvard <abbr title="versus">vs.</abbr> Yale football game -- there were no radios or TV's then, so the score would come by newspaper or 
			word of mouth -- When the score came back as 17-8 Yale, an enthusiastic Yale fan threw a boxing glove in the direction of a Harvard fan, who in response hit the glove back with a broomstick he was holding. With an idea
			in mimd, reporter George Hancock suggest they play a game of "indoor baseball", and he tied together the strings of a pair of boxing gloves to imitate a ball, used a piece of chalk to draw homeplate, a pitcher's mound, 
			and bases, and used a broom stick as a bat. This first "game" marked the invention of a new sport.</p>
			<h2>The Spread of Softball</h2>
			<p>Towards the end of the 19th century, the game of "Indoor-Outdoor Baseball" had begun to spread and catch the attention of many Americans, specifically the memebers of the Minneapolis Fire Department.
			<abbr title="Minneapolis Fire Department">MFD</abbr> Lieutenant Lewis Rober wanted his firemen to keep fit during their off-time, so he introduced them to the sport. He made some changes to the game, making a small field (smaller than a baseball field) 
			next to the fire station and using a medium sized medicine ball to play with. The game was a sucess right off the bat, and soon many other fire departments in the state joined the sport and starting to compete with each other.</p>
			<p>As softball spread, it took on many different names. When Rober moved fire stations, he named his new team the "Kittens", which lead to the game being called Kitten Ball. Until 1926 people called the sport anything from
			Kitten Ball to Indoor Ball to Diamond Ball to Playground Ball. But eventually in 1926 YMCA official Walter Hankanson coined the term Softball, which became the official name of the sport by 1930.</p>
			<h2>The Softball Association</h2>
			<p>Many attempts were made to create a softball association, but they all failed up until the 1930's. In 1933, Chicago residents Leo Fischer and Micheal J. Pauley decided to hold a massive softball torunament
			at the World's Fair in Chicago. The idea was to have all these teams come together to compete, then go off their seperate ways to make statewide orginizations, which together they would all make up a national
			governing body.</p>
			<p>In total, 55 teams competed in three different sections -- fast-pitch, slow-pitch, and women's softball. After the competition, the Joint Rules Committee -- the national authority for softball -- aprroved the
			Amateur Softball Association <abbr title="Amateur Softball Association">(ASA)</abbr>, giving softball an opportunity to grow the sport thorugh regional bodies at local and youth level.</p>
			<p>Since then, the <abbr title="Amateur Softball Association">ASA</abbr> has stayed strong, and in 2016 was rebranded as USA Softball. Softball is now one of the biggest sports in the world, becoming more and more 
			popular, spreading across countries, and even becoming an olympic sport in 1996.</p>
